2. Run `npm install`

3. Run `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

## TO-DO

1. Align noteHolder so that it starts from the bottom of the holder div

2. Make function to highlight totalNotes going up the holder

3. Actually nail down a midi player to use going forward

4. Start skeleton of the config page to place variables (like note names, tempo, etc) in their repsective places

5. Refactor components for better reusability

6. Everything else! :^)
