## TO-DO

- [x] Align noteHolder so that it starts from the bottom of the holder div
- [ ] Make function to highlight totalNotes going up the holder
- [x] Actually nail down a midi player to use going forward
- [x] Find way to export the kalimba holder _though it's not entirely working yet_
- ~~Start skeleton of the config page to place variables (like note names, tempo, etc) in their repsective places~~ no longer using config page
- [ ] Refactor components for better reusability
- [ ] Everything else! :^)
